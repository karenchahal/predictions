## General info
Before the highly disappointing Game of Thrones final season, I entered  “pool” with some friends to predict the end of the show. So, I made an app to keep track of who had the most correct predictions and to track the status of characters. The app was made to avoid any accusations of foul-play and to put some of my coding skills to the test. I would also say that my predictions were definitely better than what actually happened on the show.
